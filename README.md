### Hi, I'm Kevin Wu. :bridge_at_night: :statue_of_liberty: :tea:

~~Wow another asian kevin. how unique~~ :unamused:

Right now, I'm a rising junior at **Rutgers University-New Brunswick**, (tentatively) pursuing two B.S. degrees in **computer science** and **mathematics** as well as minoring in **philosophy**.  
When I'm not working or studying, you can find me:

 - :musical_keyboard: practicing piano

 - :books: catching up on reading

 - :bento: cooking & eating food 

 - :headphones: listening to music (peep my [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/boiledleafwater)!)

If you want to recommend me a book/album or have a project you think I would be interested in, I can be reached at:

 -  :inbox_tray:[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-wu-576a05126/)

 - :email: [kww46@scarletmail.rutgers.edu](mailto:kww46@scarletmail.rutgers.edu?subject=[Github]%20Placeholder%20Subject%20Text)

Thanks for checking out my github! :wave:
